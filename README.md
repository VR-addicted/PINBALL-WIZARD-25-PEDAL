# PINBALL-WIZARD-25-PEDAL
This is a ESPNOW based food pedal to control the action mode in Pinball Fax with your food.
Simulates the "X" key on the Meta Controller. Or what ever function is mapped to. (On the Pinball FX Gamepad. See my other projects)

What does it do, yet?
It connects to the Pinball Wizard 2025 Headset over ESP NOW. 

What is todo?
